//item strings for Prism Emeralds
@117 = ~An emerald is a brilliant green beryl, cleaved along straight box like lines, with rectangular cutting in the finished gem.  Emeralds are often connected with health, and so are used ornamentally for such a purpose. This emerald is marked with a small 'L'. It had been stolen by Prism for his use in a statue of his lady love, Ellesime. It is surmised that this gem was intended to be used as the left eye. Whether or not it was used in the statue, there is a bounty for returning it to the proper authorities.~

@120 = ~Perhaps it was wrong, but after allowing Prism to complete his 'final masterpiece' I've taken one of the emeralds out of the statue's eyes. It should bring a hefty price at the right place or a decent reward...~

@122 = ~Prism's story was a sad tale indeed.  A shame it could not have had a better ending.  Ah well, I profit in the end.  300 gold bounty for the emeralds he stole.~
@123 = ~Next time I shall have to remind myself not to pretend to be another just for some quick gold. Though Oublek kept part, I was finally rewarded for turning in the emeralds from Prism.~

@126 = ~Only half of a reduced reward for turning in one of Prism's emeralds. A measly 75 gold. Should I get the other emerald it might be prudent to check with some merchants before claiming the bounty.~

@1001 = ~The last of the emeralds! That will be another 150 gold bounty for you. Well, you'll make quite a name for yourself among the bounty hunters if you keep this up.  Whether it is for better or worse, I do not know.~
@1002 = ~One of the emeralds! It is good to see you attempting to earn honest gold, even if it is through the unsavory task of bounty hunting. I shall pay you, though less than the posted amount. Be sure to bring the other if you should find it.~
@1003 = ~The last of the emeralds! Well, it is good to see you attempting to earn honest gold, even if it is through the unsavory task of bounty hunting.  I shall pay you, though less than the posted amount.  We shall store the extra in case you decide to...alter the facts in any further dealings.~
