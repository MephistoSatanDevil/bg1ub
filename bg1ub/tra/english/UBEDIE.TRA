@0    = ~You have to pass a big test to get into the Merchants' League around here so I've been studying and studying but it just doesn't seem to sink in. Being merchants, I don't think they're too concerned about honesty and integrity, though. If you've got a potion or something that would bump up my intelligence or wisdom for the next little bit, I'd greatly appreciate it.~
@1    = ~Sure, why not?  I was never fond of tests, myself.  I'll see what I can do to help.~
@2    = ~The young Edie has asked for my assistance in cheating on Baldur's Gate's Merchants' League's dreaded entrance examination. It would admittedly be less than honorable but perhaps a little bit of intelligence- or wisdom-influencing potion might do the trick...~
@3    = ~I'm not going to help you cheat on a test!~
@4    = ~Here, I have a Potion of Genius.  Would that help?~
@5    = ~Here, I have a Potion of Mind Focusing.  Would that help?~
@6    = ~Here, I have a Potion of Insight.  Would that help?~
@7    = ~No, I won't help you.  I hope you fail your test.~
@8    = ~Well, hello again.  I hope that you have returned with something special for me...~
@9    = ~Actually, I've decided that I am not comfortable helping you cheat on a test.  My apologies.~
@10   = ~Forget it.  I won't help you, and I hope you fail.~
@11   = ~No, not yet.  I will keep looking, though.~
@12   = ~Yes, I think it just might!  Thanks so much!  Here's 50 gp.  I'll let you know how it turns out.~
@13   = ~Yes, I think it just might!  Thanks so much!  Here's 50 gp.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  The test is in one day.~
@14   = ~What a weird test... The entire point of it was to get people to cheat like that.  "Seize every possible advantage," the instructors said afterwards.  When I told them you gave that to me for only 50 gp, they passed me with flying colors!  Capitalism is so strange.  Oh, well.  I really should be getting home now.  Thank you again for your help.~
@15   = ~There's no need for that kind of attitude.  I will just go study somewhere else.~
@16   = ~Well, thanks for nothing, I suppose.  Now, if you'll excuse, I have more studying to do, and less time in which to do it, thanks to you.~


// @2 with header:
@17 = ~Cheating on the entrance examination.

The young Edie has asked for my assistance in cheating on Baldur's Gate's Merchants' League's dreaded entrance examination. It would admittedly be less than honorable but perhaps a little bit of intelligence- or wisdom-influencing potion might do the trick...~

@18 = ~Cheating on the entrance examination.

I changed my mind and will not help Edie to cheat on her Baldur's Gate's Merchants' League's entrance examination.~

@19 = ~Cheating on the entrance examination.

I could help young Edie with a magical potion. It might count as cheating, but considering she joined the Merchants' League some might say that's part of the job...~
