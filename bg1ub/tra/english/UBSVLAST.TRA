@4290 = ~Svlast's Torment
I have been witness to sad events within the Firewine ruins. An ex-paladin by the name of Svlast is being hunted by the spirit of his brother in the faith, whom he wrongfully killed. Never have I seen a more dejected and repentant soul than poor Svlast. He has begged us not to interfere but my heart does not rest easy with such a choice...~
