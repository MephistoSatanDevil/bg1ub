//#22786 - change Blunt Weapons to Club
@10170 = ~Club +1 (+3 versus unnatural creatures) : 'The Root of the Problem':
This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims of this age were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

//#19948

After all, you once called this place home. They claim to be merchants, though their organizations dabble in much more, I am sure. The three leaders of the Iron Throne are meeting with representatives of the Knights of the Shield.~

//#19950

@20029 = ~Interesting, but none of my concern. Thank you for your time.~

//#19957
@20030 = ~It is not for me to say, but I should keep an eye on your purse strings while here. Three are from the Iron Throne, supposedly the leaders themselves. The others are from Amn. I believe they are representing the Knights of the Shield. They both claim this trip is to discuss future trading relations, because the Iron Throne has grown so much as of late. I know very little of the economics of Baldur's Gate, but I would hazard a guess that both are more than mere businessmen.~

//#19962

//#19963
@20032 = ~Well, thanks for the warning. I shall be wary.~

//#19964
@20033 = ~Not much at all, but rumors are never in short supply. I hear that these meetings are more like negotiations, because the Iron Throne threatens to move into Knights of the Shield territory. I overheard one of them, accidentally of course, and I think the Iron Throne has gained a lot of power from the iron shortage. Appropriate, don't you think? They are meeting here because they consider it neutral ground and relatively safe. I doubt Keeper of the Tomes Ulraunt would have allowed their entry had he known who they are, though they have done nothing wrong here.~

//#19967

//#19968

//#19965
@20036 = ~Not a problem. We must get together sometime while you are here.~

//#19966
@20037 = ~Oh, I hope you haven't thrown your lot in with them. I hear they are such unsavory types. More into power than commerce. I overheard them talking, and they have actually profited from the iron crisis! That's why the Knights of the Shield are here; the Iron Throne has gained a lot of influence lately and threatens to take over certain Amnish interests. I am surprised that Keeper of the Tomes Ulraunt allowed them entry, but they have done nothing wrong that can be proved.~

//#19970

@20126 = ~Here friend; if you don't have the money, take this 10 gold.~

//#7780
@20127 = ~It is obvious what you need my good friend.  Living in this library fortress must leave you with little in the way of monetary funds.  Here, take this 20 gold;  It is but a trifle to me, but I'm sure it'll put you on the right track.~

//#7994
@20128 = ~Being a good friend, I'd like to entrust you with this valuable ring.  It's an heirloom, and I'm afraid of it being pilfered.  With all the thieves and brigands loitering in the wilderness, it's not to much to assume that there might be more here at the inn.~

I am sorry to say it, but I did not mean that as a compliment.  Best that you go now, for surely it will only mean trouble if you stay.  Is there anything I can do for you?~

//#14220
@40008 = ~Shoo! Them aren't yer chickens! Erlin! Erlin, someone's after the chickens!~

//#14360
@40009 = ~I know your secrets, you old hag. Maybe there's something down your gullet, as well!~

//#14361
@40010 = ~This is between us and the chickens, Ma'am, and I'm going to ask real nicely that you stay out of it.~

//#14223
@40011 = ~What do you want?~

//#14224
@40012 = ~Can you tell me how to get to Beregost?~

//#14225
@40013 = ~How much are you asking for those chickens?~

//#14226
@40014 = ~Who owns that farm just east of here?~

//#14227
@40015 = ~Never been there.~

//#14228
@40016 = ~They aren't for sale.~

//#14229
@40017 = ~Why, that's Jeb's place. Nothing good ever came of that scroundrel. Not since his wife died, at any rate.~

//#14230
@40018 = ~Please leave us be. There've been too many deaths here as it is.~

//#14231
@40019 = ~I don't know what you might be interested in, friend. You'd best talk to Erlin.~

//#14376
@40020 = ~Get off my farm, you louts!~

//#1517
@40021 = ~Who are you?  What are you doing in my estate?  Guards!  We have intruders.~

//#6136
@40022 = ~I am Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate!  I can tell you many things friend.  Perhaps you'd care to hear about the Iron Throne.  They're a new mercantile organization that have set up in Baldur's Gate.  Most of us are rather concerned over some of the Iron Thrones actions, but they have promised to supply us with iron, a resource that has been very rare as of late.  We are suspicious of Amn, our neighbor to the south.  We think that Amn has allied with the Zhentarim in an attempt to annex our glorious city.  However, Scar feels that the evidence against Amn was too easy to come by, almost as if someone were trying to frame Amn to cause friction between our two nations.  Since you are my best friend, I should tell you, I have a very beautiful daughter.  Her name is Skie, and she is now of marriageable age.~

//#6598
@40023 = ~When we charmed Entar Silvershield he told us quite a bit.  He said that the Iron Throne had recently set up in Baldur's Gate and was offering to sell iron to the city.  The Grand Dukes are worried about an invasion from Amn, and are thus taking the Iron Throne's offer seriously, despite some reservations about their intentions.~

//#8983
@40024 = ~My doors are no longer open to the likes of you!~

//#14221
@40025 = ~Leave 'em be, Enna. They know what they're lookin' for and there ain't no room on this farm for secrets, anyways.~

//#14222
@40026 = ~By Beshaba's curse, what have you done to my Enna!~

//#14232
@40027 = ~This is private land. We don't encourage no pokin' around.~

//#14233
@40028 = ~If yer lookin' for trouble, you found it, stranger. Talos! Myrkul! Malar! Sic 'em boys!~

//#14234
@40029 = ~You look like you could use a chicken. Here, friend, this one's on the house.~

//#14235
@40030 = ~You don't hear well, do you... I said this is private land.~

//#1464
@40031 = ~Jaheira and Khalid are the only decent customers we've had for some time.~

//#1465
@40032 = ~Tips are rare enough without you slowing me down.~

//#1466
@40033 = ~Back off, I've work to do.~

//#6940
@40034 = ~I don't go prying into the customers' business.  Bad for tips, it is.~

//#9020
@40035 = ~Get away from me!~

//#8179
@40036 = ~Who might you be?  No, don't answer because I really don't care.  You have gone and tracked up my kitchen with nary an invitation, nor even an unlocked door!  You better get going, or the only thing worse than the guard coming to take you off, will be if they don't get there in time to save you from me!  Out! ~

//#8180
@40037 = ~Shoo!~

//#8181
@40038 = ~Don't make me break mine foot off in your nethers!  Get going!~

//#8182
@40039 = ~If you want I could give you an entire course on cooking.  But knowing you adventurer types, you won't be around long enough.~

//#9061
@40040 = ~You're not welcome here!~

//#8192
@40041 = ~I'm waiting for daddy to come home an' tuck me in.  He's sure to be here soon.  He can't stay at the mines forever....can he?~

//#8193
@40042 = ~The reason he's not coming home is because he's dead, kiddo.  He's mulch, deceased, expired, kicked the bucket, bought the farm, croaked.~

//#8194
@40043 = ~Your dad will probably be coming back soon.  Don't you worry.~

//#8195
@40044 = ~I really hope so.  I miss him so much.~

//#8196
@40045 = ~Waaaahhh!!!  My daddy's dead!~

//#8197
@40046 = ~I'm your best friend.~

//#9027
@40047 = ~Leave me alone!  You're mean!~

//#7843
@40048 = ~Oh, welcome to you.  A pity my son is not here to meet you.  It would be most exiting for him.~

//#7853
@40049 = ~Why would he find interest in us, little mother?~

//#7855
@40050 = ~Keep the little whelp away from me.  I have no wish to spend my days babysitting your little urchin.~

//#7857
@40051 = ~It is best that he is not here while I rob his home of its possessions.~

//#7858
@40052 = ~I fear I would have little time to spend in his company.  I only meant to stop by for a moment.~

//#7844
@40053 = ~Oh, it is most exciting for any halfling to meet those with the spirit of Littleman in them.  You might be a tad.....eccentric for leaving the comforts of a well stocked hearth, but I'm sure your escapades are exhilarating...if you are in to that sort of thing.  Please come back anytime you wish.~

//#7845
@40054 = ~It's an oddity among many of our young folk that they see the essence of the great wandered Littleman in the deeds of people like you.  I personally see little appeal in leaving hearth and home.  Stay as you will, but try not to encourage the children too much.~

//#7846
@40055 = ~Hmmph!  And I should not like to see him exposed to such manners!  It's certain you do not spend much time amongst the small folk.  None who knew our ways would be so rude.  You are welcome to return when you learn a little civility.~

//#7847
@40056 = ~A shame, really.  It would be good to see how a life sleeping on a cold dungeon floor makes one irritable and unsociable.  I pity you in many ways.  Stay as you will, but at least try to be nice.~

//#7848
@40057 = ~Goodness!  How can you be such a boldfaced scoundrel?  Such an intrusion is unheard of in the company halflings prefer to keep.  The theft alone is but a mere inconvenience, but your inconsiderate attitude....it's almost more than a civil woman can bear.  Please leave me.~

//#7849
@40058 = ~Such is the pull of the wandering way.  It's a desire we have all heard much of through the tales of Littleman, though I must confess I cannot truly understand it.  It's so much more comfortable spending the nights with family by the hearth.  Fare thee well on your journeys.~

//#7850
@40059 = ~Such is the madness of Littleman.  What compels sane people to wander about the wood away from family is beyond me.  Good luck to you all the same though.~

//#7851
@40060 = ~Welcome again.  I would have thought you had moved on by now.  It's a pleasure you have not, though.~

//#7852
@40061 = ~I am surprised to see you again.  Has not the wanderers call seized your logic once again?  By Dallillia, I hope none of the children follow when you go.~

//#7860
@40062 = ~Perhaps you'd care to stay a little while and relate some tales.  I've always been fond of heroic stories, though I'd never wish to live one.~

//#9293
@40063 = ~You've outstayed your welcome!~

//#7810
@40064 = ~Hello hello hello.  It's Bunsens home you have entered, and welcome you are!  Please, rest your somewhat less-than-hairy feet by my hearth.~

//#7819
@40065 = ~Are you always this courteous to strangers that walk into your home?  It hardly seems safe to me.~

//#7821
@40066 = ~Spare me your smiles, shorty.  I merely came in to see if you had anything worth taking.  You are foolish to leave your burrow unlocked.~

//#7823
@40067 = ~My apologies, but the door was unlocked and I thought your burrow deserted.  I did not mean to intrude upon your home.~

//#7811
@40068 = ~You have been away from the small folk for some time if you have to ask that question.  It is the highest of virtues to extend familial amenity to friends we have not met yet.  You are welcome to stay as you wish, in the spirit of Cyrrollalee and all she stands for.~

//#7812
@40069 = ~Such manners!  I can think of no other in the history of this village to have insulted me so!  As much as Cyrrollalee demands welcome hospitality, at least a small measure of gratitude is expected in return.  You are not welcome in my burrow, and I think you will find the same is true among my neighbors if you continue to act as such.~

//#7813
@40070 = ~Deserted?  I think you will find that even if an owner were to stray from his hearth for years, friends and neighbors would keep his home warm and welcoming for his return.  If a stranger felt the need to use it in the meantime, I could see no one with cause to object.  No need for you to apologize.  If my home seemed deserted that simply means that I must strive all the more to present a welcoming friendly face.  Cyrrollalee would settle for nothing less.~

//#7814
@40071 = ~I wager you will not find a member of the small folk who locks their doors against visitors, known or not.  It's common courtesy to extend welcome to whomever calls, regardless of their....demeanor.  You are welcome to stay a bit if you will....but it is rather late in the day.~

//#7815
@40072 = ~If I possessed something you required, I doubt you would need but ask.  Material goods are of little import to the small folk when compared to the value of a secure hearth.  Such a rude presentation will get you naught but glares however.  Do not tarry long in my home.  You are not welcome.~

//#7816
@40073 = ~Any insult from your entry is forgiven by your courtesy.  The door is always open to friendly folk, regardless of their....parentage.  Stay a while if you wish.~

//#7817
@40074 = ~Hello again.  A pleasure as it was before.~

//#7818
@40075 = ~I see you have returned.  I trust you will stay no longer than last we met?~

//#7826
@40076 = ~Well friend, why don't you join me by the hearth; I have an extra pipe that you could use.  I have a feeling though, that you adventuring types never have time for relaxation.~

//#9294
@40077 = ~Not to be rude, but I'd rather you left immediately.~

//#15107
@40078 = ~Hmm, I prefer not to work with amateurs.~

//#15108
@40079 = ~There's a fat man by the name of Algernon staying at Feldepost's Inn in Beregost. He keeps a cloak with him in his room and I need you to get your larcenous hands on it and bring it back to me. I assure you that your reward will be handsome.  Try not to kill him, just filch it off his person.~

//#15742
@40080 = ~Pheirkas, a dwarven fighter in Baldur's Gate, has asked me to undertake what I can only call a covert mission. Staying at Feldepost's Inn in Beregost is the apparently obese Algernon. Kept on his person is a cloak that Pheirkas is interested in, shall we say, acquiring... The risk is great but the reward, I'm sure, is handsome.  Pheirkas can be found in the north west section of the city.~

//#15109
@40081 = ~Do you have Algernon's cloak with you?~

//#15110
@40082 = ~Ah, thank you so much. Here is 150 gp for your efforts.~

//#15111
@40083 = ~Oh, I do like your handiwork. Here is 200 gp for the trouble.~

//#15112
@40084 = ~Damn, I was hoping you were more the passive-aggressive type.~

//#15113
@40085 = ~How do you like my new cloak?~

//#9765
@40086 = ~Hello hello. I don't suppose you would be interested in a few trinkets? A coin or two for my finley crafted wares? Ehh, I thought not. The iron shortage wanes, but even so, the customers do not come back quite yet. Who can blame them though? They are afraid because they see that the merchants are still without wares. Who believes that a shortage has ended, when they still cannot hold a new blade in their hands. I blame the Iron Throne, I do. Many others do as well.~

//#9766
@40087 = ~Why do you blame them? What have they done?~

//#9768
@40088 = ~I am not surprised. Their role in the iron shortage was pure villainy.~

//#9769
@40089 = ~Excuse me? Where have you heard such tales? As far as any are concerned in this city, the Iron Throne is a respectable mercantile group. Such talk as yours without proof will get you nowhere, I am sure.~

//#9775
@40090 = ~Then what did you mean?~

//#9776
@40091 = ~I was talking about the Iron Throne's actions since Sarevok has assumed control of it. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. It makes no business sense that they should do this, and I think there is something very wrong at their headquarters.~

//#10104
@40092 = ~The iron shortage wanes, but merchants are still without wares. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. Since Sarevok has assumed control they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.~

//#9779
@40093 = ~Nothing direct, I suppose, though the impact is still harsh. Since Sarevok has assumed control they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. They were major importers, and without their active help it will be much longer before the average citizen feels that the crisis is over. It would seem that Sarevok is going to use the Iron Throne to fuel his harsh stance on Amn, and thus his bid for the position of Grand Duke. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.~

//#3661
@40094 = ~Business has been really bad, what with all the troubles with bandits along the coast way.~

//#15288
@40095 = ~Show us what you have to sell.~

//#15289
@40096 = ~We have no interest in buying anything right now.~

//#3691
@40097 = ~I'm one bad ass merchant.  You better not mess with me.  I"M SERIOUS!!  When I give you a price you buy it, none of that bartering crap.  DO you get ME?!!!~

//#6297
@40098 = ~I've heard a lot of stuff lately.  Iron seems to be hard to come by, what with the bandits and the faulty Nashkel ore.  Trouble seems to be brewing between Baldur's Gate and Amn.  I wouldn't be too surprised if a war broke out between the two.~

//#7082
@40099 = ~When I charmed a merchant, he said some vague things about iron shortages, bandits and war.~

//#9166
@40100 = ~I wouldn't trust you as far as I can spit!~

//#8323
@40101 = ~I know the Sturgeon be a damn sight cheaper than the Helm and Cloak, but I dinna think I would be sharing a room!  Out ye get!  I was here first!~

//#8324
@40102 = ~Share my room as long as ya like, I love the extra company.~

//#9178
@40103 = ~I'll box your ears if you step an inch closer!~

//#8348
@40104 = ~Out o' me face, fool!  I don't need your nose sniffin' about me business!~

//#8349
@40105 = ~I doubt you'll get much in the way of conversation from anyone, what with The Lady not singin'.  If that voice don't come back there are gonna be some men o' the deeps that'll never be the same.     ~

//#8350
@40106 = ~Put a cork in that blasted bard before I done plug his hole with my boot!~

//#8351
@40107 = ~I'd rather listen to the blasted silence left by the Lady than your caterwauling!  Don't make me say it again!~

//#8373
@40108 = ~Hey bud, we should drop by the Undercellar and check out the fest girls.  How 'bout it?~

//#8799
@40109 = ~I've nothing of value here.  Please leave my home as it is.~

//#8800
@40110 = ~The guards will ensure you leave!  Do I call them, or do you leave now?~

//#8801
@40111 = ~Guards!  Thieves!  Murderers!~

//#8802
@40112 = ~I don't leave my home much, so there's little I know about what goes on within the city.  Why don't you take this gold piece and enjoy yourself at the market square; there's all sorts of things to do there.~

//#9173
@40113 = ~Leave me!  You've outstayed your welcome!~

//#8228
@40114 = ~Oooo, cheeky!  Watching is extra, sweetie.~

//#9105
@40115 = ~He insists on calling me "Britannia."  Whatever gets you through the night, I guess.~

//#3520
@40116 = ~Hello there.  I'm sorry but I can't help you right now, I have many studies to finish.~

//#3524
@40117 = ~Perhaps you didn't hear me the first time, but you see, I need my privacy.  Could you PLEASE leave.~

//#6370
@40118 = ~I'm just a humble reader, there is little that I can tell you about the world outside of Candlekeep.~

//#9095
@40119 = ~I'll not speak a word after what you did!~

//#14135
@40120 = ~Take your business elsewhere!  I need nothing from the likes of you!~

//#14138
@40121 = ~Business been a little slow in the "Gate" lately.  Good to see fresh faces in town.~

//#14139
@40122 = ~You think the "Gate" is busy now?  She's a ghost town compared to before the iron shortage.~

//#14140
@40123 = ~It don't matter what you need, you'll find it in Baldur's Gate.~

//#14141
@40124 = ~Have I seen you 'round here before?  Not too many new faces come through, what with the troubles lately.~

//#14142
@40125 = ~A pity you couldn't have seen Baldur's Gate before the current troubles arrived.  The amount of commerce was staggering.~

//#7927
@40126 = ~By the gods of health and hearth, it's good to see the Friendly Arm again!  Can anyone here imagine a better sight than these hallowed halls looming before you, when you've had bandits at your backside all the way from Baldur's Gate?~

//#7936
@40127 = ~You sound most relieved to have made it here.  How treacherous was your passage?~

//#7938
@40128 = ~Put a cork in it, you blustering fool!  I care not a whit for the tale of your passage~

//#7940
@40129 = ~An ale for this weary traveler!  Best that we put something in front of his mouth if we are ever to shut him up.~

//#7928
@40130 = ~Treacherous?  Treacherous my friend?  Had the earth opened beneath my feet and spewed forth all the vermin infesting all the nine hells it could not have been more treacherous.  Banditry at all sides and I had naught but my feet, and how fast they moved, to protect me.  The singular thought that kept me on my path?  This shining beacon; this plane of joy; this well priced mead hall; call it what you will, but the Friendly Arm is home to me.  Bentley!  A mead on the house for the good advertising I give you, my friend!~

//#7944
@40131 = ~A traveler just out of Baldur's Gate has told us that the Coast Way is a dangerous road to travel.  Bandits assault all who travel its length.~

//#7929
@40132 = ~Eh?  How treacherous?  Treacherous enough that I must forgo my usual blustering tale of the journey and push past you friend, lest I die of thirst before I reach the bar.  Beware the north if you be allergic to bandits!  Bentley!  A bottle of your second-cheapest wine!~

//#7930
@40133 = ~And neither, my friend, do I care for your opinion.  If you cannot share in my joy and jubilation, then sit to the side and  I shall steer it around you.  I'll not step on your toes, but be sure you neither step on mine.~

//#7931
@40134 = ~For shame!  A fellow traveler by the looks, but by the sound you spout you were made irritable by the journey.  While I celebrate that it is over, you fret that it happened.  Lighten up, as they say, and you'll sleep better at night.~

//#7932
@40135 = ~That might have been funny if delivered by someone of better persuasion.  Alas, as it stands I am angered as though insulted.  One should never dwell on such things though.  I shall think no less of you, though I doubt I shall think any MORE of you either.  Fare thee well....somewhere else.~

//#7933
@40136 = ~HA!  You know me well, and yet we have never met.  No matter, for we are friends until death!  So swears Wade of no great distinction.  Best that you keep off the trade route north, lest a friendship-ending condition come to pass far sooner than later.~

//#7934
@40137 = ~And so I sesh to the guy, "but if that's you shister, where'sh my WIFE?"  HAW!  Oh sorry, did I just spit on you?  Oh, it's my friend back again!  Just trying to drink enough courage to head back on that dusty trail.  Perhaps I shall stay a touch longer, though; The sky is clear but my own head is cloudy.~

//#7935
@40138 = ~Well how's that for a surprise kick in the head; the sourpuss hast returned to the land of merry-makers.  I trust you will be a little more amiable?~

//#7942
@40139 = ~Good friends!  Have a round on me!~

//#5096
@40140 = ~You there!  I need some money and some healing; if you know what's good for you, you'll give it to me!~

//#5097
@40141 = ~You got to be kidding?!  You're one hobgoblin, why should we do anything but kill you?~

//#5098
@40142 = ~Here, take 25 gold.~

//#5099 
@40143 = ~Why should we help you?~

//#5100
@40144 = ~Good job, you weakling excuses for life.~

//#5101
@40145 = ~I'm a member of the Chill, the mercenary band.  If you want all of my friends breathing down your neck, then just keep on pissing me off.~

//#5102
@40146 = ~Okay!  Okay.  Here's 25 gold, now just leave us be.~

//#5103
@40147 = ~Well.....right now, there's just one of you, so I think we'll take our chances.~

//#5104
@40148 = ~You're threatening us!?  I think you've got things mixed up, you degenerate, foul smelling beast.  Before we end your miserable life you should do some begging, and maybe throw in some information about these Black Talons.~

//#5105
@40149 = ~You'll regret your decision.~

//#5106
@40150 = ~Wait!  Hey, I'm sorry, just don't kill me...please.  I'll tell you about the Black Talons.~

//#5107
@40151 = ~Go on.~

//#5108
@40152 = ~You can shut up and get out of here.~

//#5109
@40153 = ~The Black Talons are a group of mercenaries, they're part of the group who's been raiding the merchant caravans.  I just got lost in a raid a couple days back, some of the Flaming Fist had been doggin' my steps.  There, I've told you want ya wanted to hear.~

//#7013
@40154 = ~A hobgoblin told us that he worked for a mercenary company known as the Chill.  The Chill has been raiding the Coast Way road.~

//#15383
@40158 = ~Welcome to my shop.  You are free to look about as you wish, but do try not to break anything.~

//#15384
@40159 = ~I shall proceed with due care and attention.  What do you have to show me?~

//#15385
@40160 = ~You need not worry about your merchandise, as I was just leaving.~
